Write a method with the name sumDigits that has a single parameter named 'number' of type int & should return an int.
Method should only accept positive numbers.
If a negative method is passed return -1 (meaning Invalid value was passed)
The method should parse out each digit from the given number & sum up all the digits
Ex. 122 --> 1 + 2 + 2 = 5
Ex. 100 --> 1 + 0 + 0 = 1
Ex. -24 --> -1

If the number is a single digit then return that digit without any processing on it.
Ex. 1   --> 1

Tip: Use Modulo & Division operator
