Problem-9: Method Overloading

Create 2 methods with the SAME name as: convertToCentimeters
The 1st method has 1-parameter of type int which represents the `height in inches`.
In this method - You will convert inches to centimeters & pass back the number of centimeters as a double.

The 2nd method has 2-parameters of type int. One param to represent `height in feet` and the other to represent the remaining `height in inches`.
So, for example, If a person is 5 foot, 8 inches, the values passed to this method would be: 5 for feet and 8 for inches.
This method will convert feet & inches to inches, then
This method will further call the first method to get the number of centimeters, also returning the value as double

Both methods should return a real number/decimal value for total height in centimeters.
Call both methods & print out the results

TIP: 1 Foot = 12 inches
TIP: 1 Inch = 2.54 centimeters
