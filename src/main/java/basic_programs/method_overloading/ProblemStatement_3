Your class name must be "SecondsAndMinutesChallenge"

Create a method that takes time in seconds as input parameters.
Then you should convert the seconds to hours.
Next, you will display the time in hours with remaining minutes and seconds in string format.

Do this transformation in 2 steps, using the Method Overloading concept.

Create 2 methods with name: getDurationString
Following are your method signatures:
1st method has 1-parameter of type `int` named as `seconds`
2nd method has 2-parameters named `minutes` and `seconds` & both of type 'int'

Both methods return a String in format as: "XXh YYm ZZs"
where XX represent the number in hours, YY in minutes and ZZ in seconds

Note: The 1st method should call the 2nd method to get its results from 2nd.
Facts
 1 mins = 60 secs
60 mins = 3600 secs

Part-2: (BONUS): Add Validation conditions
For 1st method, the seconds parameter should be >= 0;
For the 2nd method,
the minutes parameter should be >=0 and seconds parameter should be >= 0 and <= 59.
If either method is passed an Invalid value, then print a meaningful message to the end-user.

Sample inputs & expected output

-3,945 seconds = Invalid Value. Input value for Seconds cannot be a NEGATIVE number!
3,945 seconds = 1h 5m 45s
50,000 seconds = 13h 53m 20s
78,12,000 seconds = 2170h 0m 0s
