Problem-22: Reverse the Number

Write a method with name "reverseNumber" with 1-parameter called "number" of type int.
Reverse the Number & return the number & print it in the console.

Ex: Reverse number of 5149 = 9415
Ex: Reverse number of -7136 = -6317

Tip: Use Modulo operator & Division operator wisely.
Do the dry run on the Paper first then write the code in the IDE.
Note: The Negative sign of the number should be maintained & should not be lost.


Problem-23: Check if Number is Palindrome

Write a method "isPalindrome" with 1-parameter called "number" of type int.
The method should return true if the number is a palindrome else false.
Print the Number & the result in the console like

Ex. Is -21212 a Palindrome? = true
Ex. Is  15251 a Palindrome? = true
Ex. Is  23144 a Palindrome? = false

Tip: Re-use the above reverseNumber() method written earlier in this program.
