Determining Word Representation Of Numbers Accurately
Write a method called printNumberInWord.

The method has one parameter called "number" which is a whole number.

The method needs to print "ZERO", "ONE", "TWO", ... "NINE", "OTHER"

If the input parameter number is 0, 1, 2, .... 9 or other for any other number including negative numbers.



Solution can be obtained using many ways like:

if-else if-else

traditional switch case(switch, case, break, default)

But I want you to use the enhanced switch case(switch, case -> , default)
