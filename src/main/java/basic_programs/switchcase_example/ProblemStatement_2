(1). Write a Java program that accepts a String from the end-user as Monday/Tuesday & displays the weekday number as a result.
You should define a function with name "getWeekDayInString" with a parameter named "day" of type String
It must return the number of that weekday
Note: Use traditional switch case
Validations: Input string "day" should be weekdays & return Invalid weekday if the end-user provides invalid input
Example Input & Output:
